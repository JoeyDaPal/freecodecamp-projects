If you're reading this, hi, my name is Joey, and I'm a computer science graduate looking to get back into coding after a six-month hiatus. I'm personally using freecodecamp.com to re-learn the ropes of everything. Just about everything I plan to put in this repository comes from there, and ultimately none of the code will be my own. I hope to use this repository to track my progress and also to reference concepts later. All rights belong to freecodecamp.com, please don't come after me.
